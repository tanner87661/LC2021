* File              TinyWire.h
* Date              Saturday, 10/29/17
* Composed by 		lucullus
*
* Modified by Benoit3 on 18/5/2019 to add multibyte send
*
* Wrapperclass for the new composed TinyWire library for I2C communication on ATTiny's
* The complete library is based on the librarys TinyWireM and TinyWireS, which were originally posted by
* BroHogan and then modified by jkl. I recomposed their code to unite slave and master functionality similar
* to the behavior of the Wire library on an Arduino
*
*
* NOTE! - It's very important to use pullups on the SDA & SCL lines! More so than with the Wire lib.
*
*
*
* TODO:
* - Reenable the random read function from TinyWireM (I don't really understand how it works and what it is for)
